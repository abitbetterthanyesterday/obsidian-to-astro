Hello world,

This a note to test the behavior of the application. The whole point of that
tool is to take your Obsidian note and copy them across your Astro website. But
in order to do so, we need to format the front matter, as well as replacing wiki

It contains wiki link does no exist [[fake link]] an wiki links that exists like
